## üì¶ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v20 or higher recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) instance (local or cloud-hosted)

### 2. Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Oylkka
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file by copying the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

    Now, fill in the variables in `.env.local`.

4.  **Apply the database schema:**

    ```bash
    pnpm prisma db push
    ```

    _Note: `prisma migrate` is not typically used with MongoDB in Prisma. `db push` syncs the schema to the database._

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

The application should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 3. Environment Variables

A `.env.example` file should be created to show all required environment variables.

| Variable          | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `MONGODB_URI`     | Your MongoDB connection string.                |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`    | The canonical URL of your app.                 |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | A secret key for NextAuth.js.                  |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL`  | API environment variable for Cloudinary.       |
